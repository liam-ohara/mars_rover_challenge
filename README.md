# Mars Rover Challenge
This is a small game written has part of the Northcoders Java Software Development bootcamp.

It was written to demonstrate the principles of object-oriented programming as well as test-driven development.

The challenge required the writing of an application to meet the following minimal viable product:

> * User can input the size of a rectangular plateau on which the rover will be moved
> * User can input the landing coordinates on the plateau and the compass direction the rover is facing. This will be the initial starting position of the rover
> * User can issue a commands to cause the rover to rotate either 90 degrees left or right, and to move forward in the current direction it is facing
> * The application must respond to the user to confirm the new position of the rover on the plateau
